        <h1>Float (makes no sense)</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>
                A block level element, when floated, longer takes up the whole parent. 
                    It's no longer a block. It's not even a display type.
                    You can't add margin.
            </li>
            <li>
                The element, will go as far left (or right)
                as it possibly can, unti it runs into
                another floating thing or it runs out of room.
            </li>

            <li>A floated element is in it's own universe.
                They don't pass their height up to 
                non-floating parents. Static + float = weird
            </li>

        </ol>

        <ol>
            <li>IMPORTANT</li>
            <li>To force a floated elemnt to pass it's height 
                up to it's parent...
            </li>
            <li>
                Make the parent float
            </li>
            <li>
                Set the parent to have overflow: hidden
            </li>
        </ol>
